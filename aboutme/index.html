    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Jake Brooks</h2>
    <img src="images/chilesphoto.png" alt="Image of me from hs graduation" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
    <p>I grew up mostly in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
        I lived close to the foothills of a mountain range called "The Sandias".
        I like to go mountain biking in the trails on the Sandias. <br><br>
        I like to play card games like Hearts, BS, Egyptian Rat Screw, and board games like Chess, Chamelion, and Clue. <br><br> 
        I also play piano, I've been playing for about 11 years, and one of my favorite pieces to play is called "Prelude in C# Minor, Op.3, No.2"<br><br>
        I have a little experience in programming; I took 2 classes in hs, one in Java and one in Python. 
        I know a little html but I'm not comfortable enough with it, so hopefully this class can help me with that.
